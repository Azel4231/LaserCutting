# Spirit Island

Accessories and boxes for my favourite board game of all time: [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island). 

## Invader Board
Idea and design of the board are purely based on Padraig946's brilliant design from the [BoardGameGeek Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245054/spirit-island-compact-invader-board).

There's one minor change to the design: I moved the Ravege/Build/Explore labels below the cards. This is the direction the board is mostly viewed from and I had (especially new players) be confused about the current phase because invader cards/deck hid the labels.

The fonts are JosefinSans-Regular and DK Snemand Demo, icon svgs are selfmade or from spirit island wiki.

## Invader Box (WIP)

A design for accommodating all decks and tokens required for the invader board.

* Blight tokens and blight cards
* Event cards
* Fear tokens and fear cards
* Invader cards
* Adversary reminders

### Design Notes ###

Why make a new thing?
* for fun (because I can)
* most organizers for Spirit Island are 3d-printed and thus plastic. I don't want to use that material.
* most organizers are optimized for space efficiency. I wanted to make one that optimizes set-up/tear-down time. Firstly, because setup is really annoying with small zip-bags. Secondly, because I rarely transport the box.
