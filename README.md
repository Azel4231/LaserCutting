# Laser Cutting Projects 

Idea and design of the board are purely based on Padraig946's design from the [BoardGameGeek Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/245054/spirit-island-compact-invader-board)

There's one minor change to the design: I moved the Ravege/Build/Explore labels below the cards. This is the direction the board is mostly viewed from and I had (especially new players) be confused about the current phase because invader cards/deck hid the labels.

The fonts are JosefinSans-Regular and DK Snemand Demo, icon svgs are selfmade or from spirit island wiki.
